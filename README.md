# places-service
This project integrates the Google Places API with Spring Boot to retrieve information about places such as restaurants, parks, and tourist attractions. It allows users to search for places by text query or geographic location and fetch detailed information like place names, addresses, ratings, and more.

With this integration, you can build location-based services like travel apps, local business finders, or recommendation systems.
